Web form and visualizations used for a personal Survivor fantasy league. 

Currently in progress, but finished product will have an interactive form that auto-updates graphics displaying the current winner.

### Fantasy Rules

Weekly points are given if the player properly guesses the following:
- Who will win reward?                    (+5)
- Who will win immunity?                  (+7.5)
- Who will be eliminated?                 (+10)
- Who will be safe?                       (+10)
- Will there be nudity this episode?      (+2)
- Who's quote is the episode title?       (+2)
- Will an immunity idol be found?         (+2)
- Will an immunity idol be played?        (+2)

Players will also pick a Final Three after the first episode. For each survivor chosen that makes it to the Final Three they will recieve +25 points.

When there are 8 Survivors left, weekly points will no longer be assigned. Instead, players will rank the remaining players in the order they go home. Based on these picks, the following points are assigned:
- For every survivor correctly picked safe (+2.5)
- For correctly guessing the week/place in which a survivor is eliminated (+5)
- For correctly guessing a member of the Final Three (+10)
- For correctly guessing the 3rd place Survivor (+10)
- For correctly guessing the Runner-Up (+20)
- For correctly guessing the Sole Survivor (+20)
