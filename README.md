Here you can find the rules and the code behind the web form and visualizations used for the Somerville Survivors Fantasy League. 

### Fantasy Rules

Weekly points are given if the player properly guesses the following:
- Who will win reward?                    (+5 group, +10 individual)
- Who will win immunity?                  (+5 group, +10 individual)
- Who will be eliminated?                 (+10)
- Who will be safe?                       (+5)
- Will there be nudity this episode?      (+2)
- Whose quote is the episode title?       (+2)
- Will an immunity idol or secret advantage be found?         (+2)
- Will an immunity idol or secret advantage be played?        (+2)

Before the merge points for reward and immunity will be assessed per tribe, so simply pick any player on the tribe you predict will win that challenge.

Points will double after the merge for all questions.

Other questions may be added for weekly challenges or to accomodate for specifics within the season (i.e. who is sent to Ghost Island this week?).

Players will also pick a Final Three after the first episode. For each survivor chosen that makes it to the Final Three they will recieve +20 points (max 60). For guessing the correct starting tribe that the Sole Survivor is on, the player will recieve +10 points.

When there are 8 Survivors left, weekly points will no longer be assigned for the main questions (bonus questions still count). Instead, players will rank the remaining players in the order they go home. Based on these picks, points will be assigned using a regression algorithm that determines how close each pick was to the actual order. (Thanks David for putting this part together!)
