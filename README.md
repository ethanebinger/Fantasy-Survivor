Here you can find the rules and the code behind the Web form and visualizations used for the Somerville Survivors Fantasy League. 

### Fantasy Rules

Weekly points are given if the player properly guesses the following:
- Who will win reward?                    (+5)
- Who will win immunity?                  (+7.5)
- Who will be eliminated?                 (+10)
- Who will be safe?                       (+10)
- Will there be nudity this episode?      (+2)
- Who's quote is the episode title?       (+2)
- Will an immunity idol be found?         (+2)
- Will an immunity idol be played?        (+2)

Before the merge points for reward and immunity will be assesed per tribe, so simply pick any player on the tribe you predict will win that challenge.

Players will also pick a Final Three after the first episode. For each survivor chosen that makes it to the Final Three they will recieve +25 points.

When there are 8 Survivors left, weekly points will no longer be assigned. Instead, players will rank the remaining players in the order they go home. Based on these picks, the following points (THIS IS FILLER UNTIL DAVID MAKES A REGRESSION ALGORITHM TO CALC THIS) are assigned:
- For every survivor correctly picked safe (+2.5)
- For correctly guessing the week/place in which a survivor is eliminated (+5)
- For correctly guessing a member of the Final Three (+10)
- For correctly guessing the 3rd place Survivor (+10)
- For correctly guessing the Runner-Up (+20)
- For correctly guessing the Sole Survivor (+30)
