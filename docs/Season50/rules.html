                <p>Here you can find the rules used for the Somerville Survivors Fantasy League.</p>
                <h3>Fantasy Rules</h3>
                <p>Weekly points are given if the player properly guesses the following:</p>
                <table class="rules-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr><th>Question</th><th>Points</th></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>Who will win reward?</td><td>+5 (group), +10 (individual)</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Who will win immunity?</td><td>+5 (group), +15 (individual)</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Who will be eliminated?</td><td>+10 (group), +20 (individual)</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Who will be safe?</td><td>+10</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Whose quote is the episode title?</td><td>+2</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Will an immunity idol or secret advantage be found?</td><td>+2</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Will an immunity idol or secret advantage be played?</td><td>+2</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>And other bonus questions that may vary by season!</p>
                <p>Before the merge points for reward and immunity will be assessed per tribe, so simply pick any player on the tribe you predict will win that challenge.</p>
                <p>Points will double after the merge.</p>
                <p>Other questions may be added for weekly challenges or to accomodate for specifics within the season (i.e. who is sent to Ghost Island this week?).</p>
                <p>Players will pick a Final Three after the first episode. For each survivor chosen that makes it to the Final Three they will recieve +30 points (max 90).</p>
                <p>
                    When there are 8 Survivors left, weekly points will no longer be assigned for the main questions (bonus questions still count). 
                    Instead, players will rank the remaining players in the order they go home. Based on these picks, points will be assigned using a regression algorithm that determines how close each pick was to the actual order.
                    A perfect prediction for the Final Eight recieves +140 points.
