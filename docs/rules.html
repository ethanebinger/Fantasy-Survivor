                        <tr><td>Who will win immunity?</td><td>5</td><td>15</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Who will be eliminated?</td><td>10</td><td>20</td></tr>

                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>
                    Before the merge points for reward and immunity will be assessed per tribe, 
                    so simply pick any player on the tribe you predict will win that challenge.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>2) Weekly Bonus Questions</h3>

                <p>And other bonus questions that may vary by season!</p>
                <p>
                    Questions may be added for weekly challenges (who wins the fire making challeng) 
                    or to accomodate for specifics within the season (who is sent to Ghost Island this week?).
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>3) Final Three</h3>
                <p>Players will pick who they think will be the Final Three survivors prior to the second episode.</p>
                <p>For each survivor chosen that makes it to the Final Three they will recieve +30 points (max 90).</p>
                <br>
                <h3>4) Final Eight</h3>
                <p>
                    When there are 8 Survivors left, weekly points will no longer be assigned for the main "Eliminated" and "Safe" questions. 
                    Bonus questions will continue to count. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, players will rank the remaining players in the order they go home. 
                    Based on these picks, points will be assigned based on how close each pick was to the actual order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A perfect prediction for the Final Eight recieves +140 points.
                </p>
